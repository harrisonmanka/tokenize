Description: Our tokenizer project is a project in which we are given a text file full of lexemes. Our algorithm,
             written in the C language, detects each lexeme, identifies it, and prints it out as well as catching
             any non-lexemes. To run our program with the executable given at submission, you have to use these
             commands in the command line "./tokenizer.out inputFile outputFile". Our program will then identify
             all lexemes in the input file, and write the output into the output file in the correct way.

DISCLAIMER: If the input file is brought in from a Windows system, the windows end of file character, '^M',
            will be displayed as well as error through in the outfile.
